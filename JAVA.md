* [Manifold](https://github.com/manifold-systems/manifold) - yet another Java extension framework. Probably not yet ready for production, but it's definitely in a watchlist. Just check the [demo](https://manifold.systems/images/JsonDemo.mp4) to see some black magic.

### Logging
[&uarr;](#table-of-contents)
* [Log4j2](https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2) - one of the most popular Java logging frameworks. Endless customization options, though could be a little bit complicated to perform initial configuration.

### Mobile
[&uarr;](#table-of-contents)
* [Appium](https://github.com/appium/appium) - Most popular tool for mobile devices UI automation. Note that out of the box it rarely does something useful. Heavy customization is needed for particular use case. Works really well when paired with [Selenide](#selenide).
* [Appium Espresso Driver](https://github.com/appium/appium-espresso-driver) - Not yet ready for production. Looks promising, so let it be in watch list.
* [Appium Test Distribution](https://github.com/saikrishna321/AppiumTestDistribution) - Ready solution for tests distribution on multiple mobile devices. Based on Appium and TestNG. This is what I meant saying that out of the box Appium is pretty useless. You'll have to write your own solution or use this one (at least as an example).
* [Android JUnit5 plugin](https://github.com/mannodermaus/android-junit5) - Library providing JUnit5 support for Android projects
* [Espresso](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/espresso/) - Google own testing framework for Android UI testing. Question is open which one is better option. In general, if you want flexibility - use Appium, if speed is a priority - go with Espresso.

### Mocks
[&uarr;](#table-of-contents)
* [JMockit](https://github.com/jmockit/jmockit1) - Library for creating test mocks. Not so famous as Mockito, but definitely just as good. Just a matter of taste which one to choose.
* [Hoverfly Java](https://github.com/SpectoLabs/hoverfly-java) - Java bindings for [Hoverfly](https://hoverfly.io/) - proxy for http services simulation. Flexible DSL.
* [Mockito](https://github.com/mockito/mockito) - Most popular Mocking framework for Java
* [MockWebServer](https://github.com/square/okhttp/tree/master/mockwebserver) - OkHttp client own library for mocking web server responses.

[&uarr;](#table-of-contents)
* [Pitest aka PIT](https://github.com/hcoles/pitest) - Mutation testing system for Java and the JVM. In short - testing system for unit tests. Modifies your source code and checks if test will fail. If they won't you could be doing something wrong.

### Reactive
[&uarr;](#table-of-contents)
* [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) - Reactive Extensions for the JVM â a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs using observable sequences for the Java VM. Since it's practically a standard in modern Android applications, good no know how to use it.

### REST
[&uarr;](#table-of-contents)
* [REST-assured](https://github.com/rest-assured/rest-assured) - Most popular library for REST services testing. Personally however, I prefer Retrofit / OkHttp / Moshi / AssertJ combination. But should admit that both approaches have pros and cons.

### Serverless
[&uarr;](#table-of-contents)
* [Docker In AWS Lambda](https://github.com/vladgolubev/docker-in-aws-lambda) - illustration for [this](https://medium.com/@vladholubiev/how-did-i-hack-aws-lambda-to-run-docker-containers-7184dc47c09b) blog post.

### Text Utilities
[&uarr;](#table-of-contents)
* [Apache Commons Text](https://github.com/apache/commons-text) - Collection of utils for working with strings. May be a little bit unexpected library in this list, but in almost every project I've seen there is own string utilities collection doing mostly same things.
* [JUnidecode](https://github.com/gcardone/junidecode) - Pretty useful library for handling text in exotic locales.

### WebDriver
[&uarr;](#table-of-contents)
* [Selenide](https://github.com/codeborne/selenide) - Best UI testing library. Period. Technically it's a wrapper over Selenium, but who writes tests using pure Selenium nowadays? Check [wiki](https://github.com/codeborne/selenide/wiki/Selenide-vs-Selenium) for general comparison.
* [Selenium](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium) - Testing framework for web applications. Understanding how in works is a must since it's under the hood in almost all modern UI testing libraries, but keep in mind that writing tests with pure Selenium will be much slower because of the boilerplate.

NB: In scope of UI tests since version [4.11](http://selenide.org/2018/04/02/selenide-4.11/) it's possible to use Selenide own proxy which is using Browsermob under the hood.
* [Video Recorder Java](https://github.com/SergeyPirogov/video-recorder-java) - Library for UI test execution process video recording. Just add some annotations, simple as that.
