# Automation Arsenal

**What is the purpose of this list?** To gather in one place up-to-date list of popular Java and Kotlin frameworks, libraries and tools directly (on indirectly) related to software testing, quality assurance and adjacent processes automation. Basically speaking everything related to [engineering productivity](https://saucelabs.com/blog/qa-is-not-enough-you-need-to-engineer-productivity).

**Why?** First of all - to have reference to all commonly used modern tools (and not so obvious things that can be handy or just good to know) in one place. Because it usually takes a little bit more then general Selenium knowledge to build reliable and flexible automated testing infrastructure. Another reason was to provide some guidance to those who are at the beginning of their journey - so categories are as focused as possible, keeping dead and 'vintage' libraries out of scope.

Works directly with html, without need of WebDriver. In certain cases pairs really well with WebDriver based library, greatly speeding up test execution - especially when it's needed to read huge amount of data from the UI.

### HTTP
* [OkHttp](https://github.com/square/okhttp) - Popular HTTP client by [Square](http://square.github.io/).
* [Parallec](https://github.com/eBay/parallec) - Lightning fast Parallel Async HTTP/SSH/TCP/UDP/Ping Client Java Library. Allows requesting thousands of remote endpoints, collect results and forward them elsewhere.

* [Appium Test Distribution](https://github.com/saikrishna321/AppiumTestDistribution) - Ready solution for tests distribution on multiple mobile devices. Based on Appium and TestNG. This is what I meant saying that out of the box Appium is pretty useless. You'll have to write your own solution or use this one (at least as an example).
* [Android JUnit5 plugin](https://github.com/mannodermaus/android-junit5) - Library providing JUnit5 support for Android projects
* [Espresso](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/espresso/) - Google own testing framework for Android UI testing. Question is open which one is better option. In general, if you want flexibility - use Appium, if speed is a priority - go with Espresso.

* [Awaitility](https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility) - Small Java DSL for testing asynchronous operations.

### Reporting
* [Allure 2](https://github.com/allure-framework/allure2) Test reports. Good looking, flexible and easy to use. Easily integrates with most of the  popular testing frameworks. Lots of plugins. Looking forward to see a third version. Any bets it will be released at all?
* [Allure Java](https://github.com/allure-framework/allure-java) Collection of small libraries (most of them contains just a single class) to integrate Allure with popular Java frameworks.

### JSON
* [Kotshi](https://github.com/ansman/kotshi) - An annotations processor that generates Moshi adapters from immutable Kotlin data classes.

### HTTP
* [Fuel](https://github.com/kittinunf/Fuel) - Advertised as the easiest HTTP networking library for Kotlin/Android. Frankly speaking tried in scope of one project. Tastes good, but not that good to switch from Retrofit. Still, once again - just a matter of taste.
